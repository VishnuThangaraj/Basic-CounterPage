# DOM Example: Increment, Decrement & Clear Buttons

This repository showcases a simple interactive webpage that demonstrates DOM manipulation using JavaScript. It features three buttons that allow users to increment, decrement, and clear a numerical value displayed on the page.

## Demo

You can check out the live demo [here](https://basic-counter-page.vercel.app/).

## Features
- **Increase Button**: Clicking this button will increase the displayed value by 1.
- **Decrease Button**: Clicking this button will decrease the displayed value by 1.
- **Clear Button**: Clicking this button will reset the displayed value to 0.
- **Display Area**: A section on the webpage that shows the current numerical value.

## How It Works
The JavaScript code attached to this webpage listens for click events on the increase, decrease, and clear buttons. Depending on which button is clicked, the code either increments, decrements, or resets the value in the display area.

Feel free to clone this repository, explore the code, and use it as a learning tool for DOM interactions and event handling in web development.
